			<p>The numerous great sages who appeared in India propagated noble virtues such as Truth, Non-violence, Service to mankind, Humanity, Compassion and Patience. The lives and teachings of such noble saints inspire people to walk on the path of righteousness. Mahatma Sri Krishnapremi in his work titled Vaishnava Samhitai presents the life histories of those great sages in a lucid manner.</p>

<blockquote>Vatavo Vratahinascha Strikama Gurunindakah<br />
Mataram Pitaranchapi Nindanti Pragnyamaninah
</blockquote>

<br />
<p>The brahmacharis do not observe self-discipline and celibacy. They hanker after women. Assuming themselves to be men of great knowledge they abuse the guru and disobey their parents.</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">27</h1>.
<blockquote>Grihasta Vanchakah Sarve Nanachintasamakulah<br />
Bahuputra Daridrascha Prakurvanti Dhanarjanam 
</blockquote>

<br />
<p>All the householders are deceitful and cunning. They are torn by worries. They have too many children to care for, but are very poor. They are interested only in making money.</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">28</h1>.
<blockquote>Vanaprastha Navidyante Kalavasmin Yuge Kvachit<br />
Vanchayanti Naran Moorkha Jatam Dhrutva Nakhanapi.</blockquote>

<br />
<p>In this Kaliyuga, vanaprastas (the aged men retiring to the forests as recluses) are not found anywhere. Some wicked men grow long hair and nails and cheat the common people. </p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">29</h1>.
<blockquote>Kashayadharino Loke Rasanopastha Lolupah<br />
Krodhaktyakta Kutumbastu Charanti Yatayobata</blockquote>

<br />
<p>Alas! Many on this earth now are not real asetics (yatis) but are in fact those who have abondoned their families due to their anger or despair. They are clad in saffron and yet are not rid of the infatuation for women. They loiter about, having no control over their tongue. </p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">30</h1>.
<blockquote>Evam Sarveshu Dharmeshu Vinashteshu Kalauyuge<br />
Sarve Pishachavatloke Charanti Sukhavarjita</blockquote>

<br />
<p>Thus, all the dharmas have declined, people find no peace and well-being in this Kaliyuga. They simply wander about like evil spirits.</p>
