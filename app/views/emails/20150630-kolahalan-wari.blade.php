														<p><strong>Definition of Wari:</strong></p>
														<p><strong>Mavuli Sant Shreshta Nivrthidas Sri Gyaneswar Maharaj</strong> defines a Varkari as a noble person who has surrendered his body/ mind/karma and life too in the service of Lord Vittala. He has hence no deal to make or nothing to SEEK except for repeated opportunity to serve him or HIS devotees.</p>
														<p>काय&nbsp; वाचा आिण…मन–जीव सव’सव–उदार<br>
														बापरक़ख़ुमादवीवरु–विठ॒ठलाचा–वारिकर</p>
														<p><strong>Concept of Wari</strong></p>
														<p>The PANDHARPUR WARI is distinct from all other forms of pilgrimages like the ‘yatra’ in a variety of ways. To begin with, it is a collective form of BHAKTI (worship) often undertaken as an extension of family tradition. It has a predetermined scheduled and route and has no purpose other than sheer worship.</p>
														<p>The ‘yatra’ on the under hand is undertaken by individuals at their convenience to a variety of deities for personal reasons. <em><strong>Participating in the WARI is its own reward and Panduranga the lone object of worship</strong></em>.</p>
														<p>The WARI is a microcosm of the vast sects, sub-sects, castes and trades that go into the making of the state of Maharastra – as men, women, young and old people from all walks of life, age and socio-economic status walk alongside each other, never for a moment being aware of their differences or status.</p>
														<blockquote><p><strong><em>Most unconventional is the belief that the Lord Vithhal awaits this meeting with his devotees (bhaktas), lead by Sri Mavuli Gyaneswar Maharaj Himself.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
														<p>The eagerness to meet Lord Vitthal and the repetitive chanting of Gyanoba&nbsp; Tukaram / RAM-KRISHNA-HARI refrain during the walk are unifying bonds among different peoples all termed WARKARIS. No other rituals dot the WARIKARI horizon unlike in the ‘yatra’ where host of rites and rituals are prescribed and have to be adhered to.</p>
														<p>In short, WARI <em>is synonymous with annual pilgrimage on foot to PANDHARPUR and the WARKARI refers to the ardent devotee of Lord Vitthal</em>.</p>
														<p>The WARKARI SAMPRADAYA (sect) considers all the EKADASHIs (the eleventh days after waxing and waning of the moon) as especially auspicious. Even among these are considered more significant the Aashaadhi (June-July) and Kartiki (November-December) Ekadashis. These Ekadashis coincide with the new-moon fortnights. That is when PANDHARPUR WARI is undertaken in Maharashtra.</p>
														<p>Besides these, two more WARIs viz the Chaitra (or spring – first lunar month) and Maghi (eleventh month of the Hindu lunar calendar) Ekadashis are also deemed to be important. The latter two are particularly attended by devotees from neighbouring Karnataka.</p>
														<p><strong>Unique Features of The Wari :</strong></p>
														<p>In the WARI participant WARKARIS are undaunted by natural impediments (rain or shine, winds and darkness) and hardships of the walk. <em><strong>This is because of their faith and conviction that they would be able to meet their Lord (Vitthal) since MAULI is by their side, caring and guiding them through this pilgrimage.</strong></em> While on the WARI some faithfuls do not consume even a drop of water during the day.</p>
														<p><strong>The Wari Tradition</strong></p>
														<p>The WARI tradition dates back into times. Saint Dnyaneshwar’s great grandfather – Trymbakpant Kulkarni – used to walk the WARI from his native Apegaon to Pandharpur. Saints Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Sawta Mali, Chokhoba and Tukaram used to participate in the WARI in their own life times. The WARI could hence be treated as a confluence of the practitioner saints and proponents of the <strong>BHAGWAT DHARMA</strong>.</p>
														<p>The tradition of the present ‘PALKHI SOHALA’ (literally WARI of festivities) can be traced to the year 1685 around 36 years after Saint Tukaram attained divinity (1649). It was initiated by Taponidhi Narayan Maharaj Dehukar, son of saint Tukaram. The ‘PADUKAs’ of Saint Tukaram would be carried over to Alandi where along with the ‘PADUKAs’ of Saint Dnyaneshwar they would form the WARI inching towards Pandharpur to meet their Lord Vitthal (God). The common chants / refrains of “Dnyanoba – Tukaram” that one hears in the PALKHI were initiated by Taponidhi Narayan Maharaj Dehukar. The practise of the PADUKAS jointly leaving for Pandharpur from Alandi continued for close to 150 years.</p>
