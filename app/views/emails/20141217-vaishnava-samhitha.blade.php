The lives and teachings of such noble saints inspire people to walk on the path of righteousness. Mahatma Sri Krishnapremi in his work titled Vaishnava Samhitai presents the life histories of those great sages in a lucid manner.</p>

<blockquote>Vinashta Rajavanshascha Sarvadharma Abhirakshakah<br />
Yobhavedbalavan Raja Saeva Svarthalolupah.</blockquote>
