			<p>The numerous great sages who appeared in India propagated noble virtues such as Truth, Non-violence, Service to mankind, Humanity, Compassion and Patience. The lives and teachings of such noble saints inspire people to walk on the path of righteousness. Mahatma Sri Krishnapremi in his work titled Vaishnava Samhitai presents the life histories of those great sages in a lucid manner.</p>

<p>Listening to these words of the Lord, all the devas and saints felt relieved and happy. Paying their respects to Lord Madhusoodana, the very embodiment of eternal bliss, they took leave of Him and reached their abodes, anticipating the advent of the devotees on the earth.</p>
