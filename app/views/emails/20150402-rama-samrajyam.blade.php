														<p align="center"><strong>Rama Samrajyam in Prema Samrajyam!</strong></p>

														<p>The tradition continues in a great manner with all humility yet blossoming with fresh fragrance of Rama Bakthi and Guru Seva.</p>
														<p>VAMSI KULA DHARMA RAMA SEVA..These were not mere expressions but each words came ALIVE here in this event<br>
														Even, as we fully believe that it is a futile exercise to describe or to unfold the events, we attempt it with full reverence as in these communication even a failure to bring full details will ultimately be downplayed by Sri Anna Bhaktas, the targeted audience for this narration.</p>
														<p>This year Sri Ramanavmi celebration at Senganur provided the bhakths with unique experience of “Re- Living” those moments of very first Grand Ram Navmi at Ayodhya. The entire village turned out to be as Ayodhya as Sri Anna himself conducting every event and spending his valuable time minutely in all arrangements made.</p>
														<p>Before we make a plunge in daily events between 26/3 to 30/3 we give brief list of people who were mainly responsible for the grand events. (Please forgive us if we inadvertently omitted some Bhagavathas/Persons)</p>																												<p>This list is in addition from Sri Anna’s family members and relatives</p>
														<p>Complete bhajan program was lead as usual by Tiruvisanallur, Sri.Ramakrishna Bhagavathar and group. They performed almost Non Stop Sampradaya Bhajans from 26/3 morning 6.00Am to 30/03 morning 6.30Am. Perhaps it is easier to attempt what they have not covered, as the list will be short, than to share all songs. To put it mildly it is BENCHMARK of Sathguru Swamigal’s Sampradaya Bhajans.</p>
														<p>To enable our beloved bakthas to visualize these we wish to provide location details of major events.</p>
