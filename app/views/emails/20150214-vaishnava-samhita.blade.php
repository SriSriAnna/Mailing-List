			<p>The numerous great sages who appeared in India propagated noble virtues such as Truth, Non-violence, Service to mankind, Humanity, Compassion and Patience. The lives and teachings of such noble saints inspire people to walk on the path of righteousness. Mahatma Sri Krishnapremi in his work titled Vaishnava Samhitai presents the life histories of those great sages in a lucid manner.</p>

<blockquote>Mandah Sumandamatayo Mandabhagyah Kalau Narah
Tasmat Nashaknuvantyeva Vidhatum Niyaman Bahoon.</blockquote>

<br />
<p>People born in this Kaliyuga are lazy, slow-witted and unfortunate. Hence they will not come forward to observe the various kinds of strict austerities.</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">37</h1>
<blockquote>Tasmat Niyamasamanya Nirapeksham Mahaphalam
Dharmam Kamapi Lokesmin Pratikshante Narah Kila</blockquote>

<br />
<p>And hence they long to have some way that is devoid of even the simplest austerities, but, at the same time, is capable of yielding noble results in this Kaliyuga.</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">38</h1>
<blockquote>Tameva Dharmam Vakshyami Shrunudhvam Sakalah Surah
Mannamakirtanam Hanta Sarva Dharma Uttamam Nanu</blockquote>

<br />
<p>So, I shall enlighten you of such a dharma. Listen to Me Oh! Devas! Is it not the chanting of My sacred Divine Names superior to the host of all other dharmas?</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">39</h1>
<blockquote>Kalikala Uchitam Dharmam Namasankirtanatmakam
Prakashayitum Adyaiva Bhavami Kripayotsukah</blockquote>

<br />
<p>Due to My causeless mercy, I am very much pleased and enthusiastic to spread the glory of that Dharma which manifests itself in the Kirtan of my Divine Names. This is the path most suitable to this Kaliyuga.</p>
<hr />
<h1 class="chapter">40</h1>
<blockquote>Madiyan Preshayishyami Naradadeen Mahattaman
Tvaraya Bhuvamudhartum Kalikalmashasagarat</blockquote>

<br />
<p>In order to uplift the world from the ocean of the morass of the Kaliyuga, I shall at once send My devotees like the noble Narada.</p>
